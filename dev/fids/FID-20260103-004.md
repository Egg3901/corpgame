# FID-20260103-004: Create /guide Page and Overview Analytics

## Status: COMPLETED

## Problem
The game lacks comprehensive user-facing documentation. Players need to understand:
- 21 sectors and their relationships
- 8 resources and 9 products
- 4 unit types (Retail, Production, Service, Extraction)
- Production chains and vertical integration
- Action point system
- Corporate governance (10 proposal types)
- Financial system

The overview page also needs additional analytics for better player engagement.

## Solution
1. Create `/guide` page with strategic-level documentation (no formulas)
2. Add guide link to AppNavigation
3. Enhance overview page with additional analytics cards

## Acceptance Criteria
- [x] Guide page accessible at /guide
- [x] All 11 game systems documented with strategic explanations
- [x] Navigation includes Game Guide link
- [x] Overview page shows Action Points, Net Worth, Market Presence cards
- [x] TypeScript: 0 errors

## Files Changed
- NEW: `app/guide/page.tsx` - Main guide page (~700 lines)
- NEW: `components/guide/GuideSection.tsx` - Reusable section component (~60 lines)
- EDIT: `components/AppNavigation.tsx` - Add guide nav link
- EDIT: `app/overview/page.tsx` - Add analytics cards (Action Points, Net Worth, Market Presence)

## Guide Sections Implemented
1. Introduction - Game goals, victory, hourly turns
2. Corporations - CEO role, HQ, focus types, board
3. Business Units - 4 unit types with icons and descriptions
4. Market Entry - States as markets, capacity tiers
5. Resources - 8 commodities with sector associations
6. Products - 9 products with sector associations
7. Production Chains - Visual flow diagrams (Steel, Construction examples)
8. Action Points - Regeneration, spending wisely
9. Governance - 8 proposal types with icons
10. Financials - Revenue, costs, dividends breakdown
11. Corporate Actions - Marketing Campaign, Supply Rush

## Content Style
Strategic explanations without exact formulas. Teaches players what systems do and how to think strategically, not the precise numbers.
