# FID-20260102-001: Remove Automatic Corporation Creation on Registration

## Status: COMPLETED

## Problem
Corporation and stock market pages are failing with "Mongo DB not connected" errors in production (Vercel). The automatic corporation creation during user registration may be causing issues with the MongoDB connection or timing.

## Root Cause
During user registration (`app/api/auth/register/route.ts`), the system automatically creates a corporation for the new user via `CorporationService.createForUser()`. This adds complexity and potential points of failure during registration.

## Solution
Remove the automatic corporation creation from the registration flow. Users will create corporations manually through the existing UI at `/corporation/create`.

## Changes Required
1. Remove `CorporationService` import from register route
2. Remove auto-corporation creation code block (lines 79-86)
3. Keep welcome message functionality

## Files Modified
- `app/api/auth/register/route.ts`

## Testing
- Register a new user
- Verify registration succeeds without auto-corporation
- Verify user can manually create corporation at `/corporation/create`
